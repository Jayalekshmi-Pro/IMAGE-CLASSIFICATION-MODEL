Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model aims to accurately classify input images into their respective categories by learning hierarchical patterns and features from the image data.Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of computer vision and deep learning. It involves assigning a label to an input image based on its visual content. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in this domain due to their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from raw image pixels.Traditional machine learning approaches require manual feature extraction, whereas CNNs eliminate this need by learning features directly from the data. This project leverages the capabilities of CNNs to build a robust and scalable image classifier.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this task may be a publicly available one such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, or a custom dataset with labeled categories. It will be divided into three subsets:
Training Set: Used to train the CNN model , Validation Set: Used to tune hyperparameters and monitor generalization ,Test Set: Used to evaluate the final model performance on unseen data.Each image will undergo preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and possibly data augmentation to improve the diversity of training data.

Model Architecture:
The CNN architecture will be composed of the following components:
Convolutional Layers: To extract spatial features from the image
Activation Functions (ReLU): To introduce non-linearity
Pooling Layers (e.g., MaxPooling): To reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps
Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training
Fully Connected Layers: To map the features to the output class probabilities
Softmax Output Layer: To produce a probability distribution across target classes The architecture may also incorporate enhancements like batch normalization, learning rate scheduling, or early stopping to improve performance and training efficiency.

Implementation:
The model will be implemented using either:
TensorFlow/Keras: For a high-level API that simplifies model creation
PyTorch: For more flexibility and control over the training loop
The training process will involve: Defining the loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy)
Selecting an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD)
Monitoring accuracy and loss over multiple epochs
Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of filters, kernel sizes, and number of epochs will be tuned based on validation performance.

Evaluation :
The model will be evaluated on the test dataset, and performance will be reported using:
Accuracy ,Precision, Recall, and F1 Score ,Confusion Matrix ,Training/Validation Loss and Accuracy Curves ,Additionally, sample predictions, misclassified images, and visualizations of convolutional filters may be included to interpret the modelâ€™s behavior.

Deliverables:
A fully functional Python script or Jupyter notebook
A trained CNN model
Performance metrics and visualizations
A brief documentation/report describing the approach, architecture, and results
